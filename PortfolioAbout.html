     The accent says it anyways, I was born in East India,
     <br>
     I spent my childhood in Darjeeling<abbr title="West Bengal">(W.B)</abbr>,
     <br>
      and moved to Kerala, years back. 
      <br>
       I did most of my education here so far, and I'm still continuing the rest,
       <br>
       meeting new friends in a different place was always a great experience to have.
       <br>
    Kerala has been a great for me so far, and I hope to explore more in my next years!

From a small age, I had the curiosity to learn something new, whether it involved<br>
learning a new skill or perfecting an old, a part of me always enjoyed it.<br>
On my way I had ups and downs, like everyone else, had friends to carry me, <br>
rivals to teach me, but making connections with people(though I'm mostly shy type)<br>
it was fun. I learned a lot, I taught a lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
I may not have a stable hobbies right now(complicated thoughts signifies)<br>
but I spent the lock-down period productively(like a bit) and I'm gonna<br>
talk about that!<br>

I love to cook! It all started from cooking a simple instant noodle to craving to<br>
 try something else. I still got a lot to learn from my Mom(the best cook in the house).<br>

I like to watch anime, binge watching all night during weekends(and also lockdown)<br>
and I have watched plenty of series. <br>
<img src="psychopass.jpg" alt="Psychopass" style="float: left;width:400px;height:200px;">
One of my favorite being Psycho-Pass(I highly recommend to you), explores about <br>
a world in future and on its Police and crime systems.

Lock-down gave me ample of time to play games(being lazy),<br>
 though some of them got banned(yeah you know it), which was eh!<br>
 I'm currently playing a DB-franchise: 
 <a href="https://dble.bn-ent.net/en/" target="_blank" >
 Dragon Ball Legends
 </a>
 , and if uou are a <br>
 Dragon Ball fan(like me) and love a bit of PVP, then this one could be for you!<br>
 Play-style wise the game is worth(just addicted), and content wise it's great!<br>
 If you are giving a shot, I did recommend few YouTubers who are really good trainers,<br>
 <img src="DBL.gif" alt="DBLegends" style="float: right;">
 and friends that will aid you a lot.

  if you are interested!<br>

Lastly, I grew fond of gardening. I'm still trying to learn deep about it,<br>
for now it's more like,<br>
risk it for a biscuit<br>
but so far, I'm loving it!<br>
