<title> Thanks a lot! </title>

<h1> 
THANK YOU!
</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
This took quite a bit of time to make, either cause I'm very inexperienced,<br>
or, simply made tons of mistakes. A lot of trial and error went through it,<br>
had to start over multiple times, but with every step,<br>
 I learned something new! The CS knowledge I knew before this was<br>
frankly none, but now I can proudly say I know some basics(or somewhat).<br>
Andd I would like to thank Bijoy SIR(emphasis that) for being my manual in every step(and pewer),<br>
 the IEEE body and Judis for the time and energy they spent to teach us.<br>
Also my friends, Nitch and Rahman, for the ideas and motivation!<br>
This wouldn't have been possible without their help.<br>
A big Merci to you guys!
